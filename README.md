# cool_clock
A lightweight floating clock for Mac users. Perfect for fullscreen or multi-desktop workflows‚Äîno need to move the cursor to the top menu bar. Add it as a Chrome extension, keep it always visible, draggable, and switch between analog or digital time easily.

This is a lightweight, always-accessible clock built specifically for Mac users who often work in full-screen mode or manage multiple desktops. One common frustration for productivity-focused users is the difficulty in quickly checking the time without disrupting their workflow. On macOS, the system clock is only visible in the top menu bar‚Äîmeaning you have to move your cursor to the top of the screen just to see the time. This can be particularly annoying when working across several desktops or in distraction-free full-screen apps.

To address this issue, I created a floating clock widget that runs as a Chrome extension. It provides a clean, minimal UI that remains always visible, even when you're switching between full-screen windows or working on secondary displays. You no longer need to exit full-screen mode or hover at the top of your screen just to glance at the time.

The clock is fully draggable and custom-positionable, allowing you to place it exactly where it suits you‚Äîwhether it's tucked away in a corner or floating next to important content. You can switch between analog and digital display modes based on your preference, and the interface is designed to stay out of your way while still being easy to spot.

It's especially helpful for designers, developers, video editors, writers, or anyone who needs to stay focused while keeping track of time. Whether you're timing work sessions, keeping an eye on meetings, or just avoiding the distraction of constantly checking the system bar, this tool offers a simple yet powerful solution.


Because it‚Äôs built as a Chrome extension, installation is straightforward, and you can use it across Chrome-based environments. While originally designed with macOS in mind, it works well across all desktop platforms.
